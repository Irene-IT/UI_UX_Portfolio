## 🎯 Purpose and Functionality

The goal of this project is to explore the process of building a modern, visually appealing, and interactive web interface using current frontend technologies.  

Key objectives include:
- Developing a responsive design using **Tailwind CSS**  
- Integrating **3D elements** with **Three.js** and **React Three Fiber**  
- Implementing **animations and transitions** with **GSAP**  
- Enabling **form submissions** via **EmailJS** without a backend  
- Enhancing **user experience (UX)** through iterative testing and UI refinements  

The project serves as a hands-on environment for learning and experimenting with the modern React ecosystem and related tools.

- **React (v19)** — UI library for component-based architecture  
- **Tailwind CSS** and **Material Tailwind** — for styling and responsive layout design  
- **GSAP** and **Motion** — for smooth, performant animations  
- **Three.js**, **@react-three/fiber**, **@react-three/drei**, **@react-three/postprocessing** — for 3D graphics and interactive visual elements  
- **EmailJS** — for handling form submissions without a backend  
- **ESLint**, **PostCSS**, **Autoprefixer** — for code quality and CSS processing  
- **Lucide React** and **Iconify** — for icons and UI visuals
